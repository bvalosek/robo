        <p> Several awesome free and open-source pieces of software were used
        in Robo.

        A few of these libraries require their license agreements to be
        included with any derived works&dash; a small price to pay...  consider
        it done.</p>

        <p>Below is the entire list of third-party code used in Robo. A huge thanks is due to all of the developers that had a part in making this framework come to life.</p>

        <ul class="apps">
            <li>Backbone.js</li>
            <li>Font Awesome</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>keymage.js</li>
            <li>require-less</li>
            <li>RequireJS</li>
            <li>Sizzle</li>
            <li>text</li>
            <li>Underscore.js</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Robo's font is Google's Roboto.</p>
        <p>Robo's visual style is inspired heavily by the sexy work being done by the UX/UI people at Microsoft and Google with their latest operating systems.</p>
