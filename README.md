# Robo

Robo is a comprehensive Javascript framework for large-scale client applications.

* **Large-scale Javascript apps are hard.** Javascript's best and worst feature
  is its ability to effectively get away with anything you want. Consistent and
  scalable practices are essential to write kickass modern apps.

* **Boilerplate is obnoxious and creates friction during development.**
  Unnecessary repetition is annoying, wastes time, and makes it difficult to
  maintain a high development velocity when changes occur.

* **A great framework let's you progressively use its features.** Progressive
  enhancement is a great philosophy for UI design; a framework should function
  the same way.
