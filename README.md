# Robo

Robo is a comprehensive Javascript framework for large-scale client applications.

* **Large-scale Javascript apps are hard.** Javascript's best and worst feature
  is its ability to effectively get away with anything you want. Consistent and
  scalable practices are essential to write kickass modern apps.

* **Boilerplate is obnoxious and creates friction during development.**
  Unnecessary repetition is annoying, wastes time, and makes it difficult to
  maintain a high development velocity when changes occur.

* **A great framework let's you progressively use its features.** Progressive
  enhancement is a great philosophy for UI design; a framework should function
  the same way.

## Getting Started

### Get the source

```
git clone git@github.com:bvalosek/robo.git
```

### Compatibility

Robo makes use of ECMAScript5 features such as `Object#defineProperty()`,
`Function#bind()`, and `Array#forEach()`, which limits its compatibility to
modern, compliant browsers.

Robo should work with the following browsers:

* Chrome 7+
* Firefox 4+
* Safari 5.1+
* Opera 4+
* Internet Explorer 9+

#### Building

#### Tests

Run a http server from the root of the repo, and browse to e.g. `localhost:8080/test/index.html`.
