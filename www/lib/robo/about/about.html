    <p>Robo was built with several amazing free and open-source libraries.
    Leveraging the creative talent of the community allowed the creation of
    this framework to be even more fun and rapid that it already was. A few of
    these libraries require their license agreements to be included with any
    derived works&dash; a small price to pay... consider it done.</p>

    <blockquote>"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of
        giants"</blockquote>

    <p>Below is the entire list of third-party libraries used in Robo. You can
    not only see what makes this bad boy tick, but find their licensing terms
    and websites as well.</p>
